            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>HAving long ſince obſerved, that the greateſt part of thoſe that learn <hi>Euclid</hi>'s <hi>Elements,</hi> are very often diſſatisfied therewith, becauſe they know not the uſe of <hi>Propoſitions</hi> ſo inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in appearance; and yet ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult: I thought it might be to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, not only to make them as eaſie as poſſible, but alſo to add ſome <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes</hi> after each <hi>Propoſition,</hi> to ſhew how they are applicable to Practice. And this hath obliged me to change ſome of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnoſtrations,</hi> which I looked upon to be too troubleſome, and above the uſual
<pb facs="tcp:96453:5"/> reach of beginners, and to ſubſtitute others more intelligible. For this cauſe, I have Demonſtrated the <hi>Fifth Book</hi> after a method much more clear than that, that makes uſe of <hi>equimultiples.</hi> I have not given all the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes</hi> of the <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> for that would have made it neceſſary to recite all the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and would have made the Book too big, and too hard. Wherefore, I have only made choice of ſome of the plaineſt and eaſieſt to conceive, I would not have you to ſtand too much upon them, nor make it your ſtudy to underſtand them perfectly becauſe they depend upon other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples beſides, for which Reaſon I have diſtinguiſhed them with the <hi>Italick</hi> Letter. This is the deſign of this ſmall Treatiſe, which I willingly publiſh in a time when the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> are more than ever ſtudied.</p>

            <p>THE Reader having peruſed the Authors Preface, with this farther intimation, that he will find the Subject and Scope of this work Succinctly and pertinently preſented to him, in the Argument before each particular book, may I preſume, expect the loſs from me, and I ſhall not at all endeavor to beſpeak the Readers acceptance of <hi>Euclid</hi>'s Elements, or perſuade him to beleive, the Neceſſary and Excellent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs thereof, becauſe every mans Experience, ſo far as he understands them, is an abundant Teſtimony thereunto. Neither ſhall I need to commend the Method with the uſes of our Author <hi>D'Chales,</hi> (who is well known to the learned of this Age by
<pb facs="tcp:96453:6"/> his Several excellent Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Tracts (<note n="*" place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:96453:6"/> have only one thing more to add, and that upon the account of an Objection I have met with, that here is not all the Books of <hi>Euclid,</hi> and it is true, here is not all, here are only the first ſix Books, and the Eleventh, and Twelfth, the other being purpoſely omitted by our learned Author, who judged the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe to be ſufficient, for all the parts of the Mathematicks,<note n="*" place="margin">See Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before the Eleventh Book, <hi>Page</hi> 304.</note> and I could alſo give Inſtances of other excellent Authors, that are of his Opinion, and have taken the like courſe, nay the truth is ſome very learned in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks, have reduced the Propoſitions of theſe Books to a much leſſer Number, and yet have thought them a compleat foundation to all the Sciences Mathematical, but I ſhall not trouble my Reader farther on this account, not doubting but when he hath peruſed and well conſidered our <hi>Euclid,</hi> he will have a better Opinion thereof, then any thing I can now ſay, may Juſtly hope to beget in him, and ſo I ſhall ſubmit my whole Concernment here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to the Impartial Reader, and remain ready to Serve him.</p>

                  <p>We make uſe of Three Letters to expreſs an Angle, and the Second Letter denotes the Angular Point, as the Angle BAD, is the Angle which the Lines BA, AD, doth form, at the Point A; the Angle BAC, is that which is formed by the Lines BA, AC; the Angle CAD is comprehended under the Line CA, AD.</p>

The Firſt, that from a given Point there cannot be drawn no more than one Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular to the ſame Line.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96453:27"/> ACB: Therefore ACB ſhall not be a Right Angle, neither AC a Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, that from the ſame Point A, there can only be drawn two equal Lines; for Example, AC, AD, and that if you draw a Third AE, it ſhall not be equal. For ſince AC, AD, are equal, the Angles ACD, ADC, are equal, <hi>(by the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.)</hi> now in the Triangle AEC, the Exteriour Angle ACB is greater than the Interiour AEC; and thus is the Angle ADE greater than AED. Therefore the Line AE, greater than AD; and by conſequence AC, AE, are not equal.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, if the Line AC maketh the Angle ACB acute, and ACF obtuſe, the Perpendicular drawn from A, ſhall fall on the ſame Side which the Acute Angle is of; for if one ſhould ſay that AE is a Perpendicular, and the Angle AEF is Right; then the Right Angle AEF would be greater than the Obtuſe Angle ACE.

Let the ſame be the number A, 144, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the Square AD, and its Root by the Line AB. Moreover I know that the Line required AB muſt have Two Figures. I therefore imagine that the Line AB is Divided in C, and that AC re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth the firſt Figure; and BC the Second. I ſeek the Root of the Firſt Figure of the Number 144, which is 100, and I find that it is 10; and making its Square
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:96453:62"/> 100, repreſented by the Square GF; I Subtract the ſame from 144, and there remains 44 for the Rectangles GC, FL, and the Square CL. But becauſe this gnomonicall Figure is not proper, I tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Rectangle FL, in KG, and ſo I have the Rectangle KL containing 44. I know alſo almoſt all the Length of the Side KB; for AC is 10, therefore KC is 20: I muſt then Divide 44, by 20; that is to ſay, to find the Diviſor, I double the Root found, and I ſay how many times 20 in 44? I find it 2 times, for the Side BL; but becauſe 20 was not the whole Side KB but only KC; this 2 which cometh in the Quotient is to be added to the Diviſor, which then will be 22. So I find the ſame 2 times preciſely in 44, the Square Root then ſhall be 12. You ſee that the Square of 144 is equal to the Square of 10, to the Square of 2, which is 4, and to twice 20, which are Two Rect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angles comprehended under 2, and under 10.</p>

                  <p>The Reaſon or habitude of one Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to another, is divided into rational Reaſon, and irrational Reaſon. Rational Reaſon is a habitude of one Magnitude to another, which is commenſurable thereto; that is to ſay, that thoſe Magnitudes have a common meaſure, which meaſureth both exactly. As the reaſon of a Line of 4 Foot, to a Line of 6, is rational; becauſe a Line of two Foot meaſureth both exactly: and when this happeneth, thoſe Magnitudes have the ſame Reaſon as one Number hath to another. For Example, becauſe that the Line of two Foot, which is the common meaſure, is found twice in the Line of 4 Foot, and thrice in the Line of 6; the firſt to the ſecond ſhall have the ſame Reaſon as 2 to 3.</p>
                  <p>Irrational Reaſon is between Two Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes of the ſame Species which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commenſurable, that is to ſay, that have not a common meaſure. As the Reaſon of the Side of a Square to its Diagonal. For there cannot be found any meaſure, although never ſo little, which will meaſure both preciſely.</p>
                  <p>Four Magnitudes ſhall be in the ſame Reaſon, or ſhall be Proportionals, when the Reaſon of the firſt to the ſecond, ſhall be the ſame, or like to that of the third to the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96453:116"/> fourth: wherefore to ſpeak properly, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion is a ſimilitude of Reaſon. But one findeth it difficult to underſtand in what conſiſteth this ſimilitude of Reaſon. It is only to ſay that two habitudes or Relations be alike. For <hi>Euclid</hi> hath not given a juſt Definition, and which might have explained its Nature; having contented himſelf to give us a mark by which we may know, if Magnitude have the ſame Reaſon. And the obſcurity of this Definition hath made this Book difficult. I will endeavour to ſupply this default.</p>

                  <p>To make this Definition yet clearer; I will in the firſt place prove, that if there be the ſame reaſon of A to B, as there is of C to D; A will contain as many times the Aliquot parts of B, as C doth of D.

                  <p>It is to be taken notice, that there is a great deal of difference between double Ratio and duplicate Ratio. We ſay that the Ratio of four to two is double, that is to ſay, four is the double of two, whence it followeth that the number two, is that which giveth the Name to this Ratio, or rather to the Antecedent of this Ratio. So we we ſay, double, triple, quadruple, quintuple, which are Denominations taken from thoſe numbers, <hi>duo, tres, quatuor, quinque,</hi> compared with unity: for we better conceive a Reaſon when its terms are ſmall. But as I have already taken notice, thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations fall rather on the Antecedent than on the Reaſon it ſelf: we call that double, triple, Reaſon or Ratio, when the Antecedent is double or triple to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent: but when we ſay the Reaſon is duplicate, we mean a Reaſon compounded of two like Reaſons, as if there be the ſame Reaſon of two to four, as of four to eight; the Reaſon of two and eight being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of the Reaſon of two and four, and of that of four and eight, which are alike; and as equal the Reaſon or Ratio of two to eight, ſhall be duplicated by each. Three to twenty ſeven, is a duplicated Reaſon of that of three to nine. The Reaſon of two to four is called ſubduple;
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:96453:120"/> that is to ſay, two is the half of four: but the reaſon of two to eight is duple of the ſub-duple; that is to ſay, that two is the half of the half of eight: as three is the third of the third of twenty ſeven; where you ſee there is taken twice the Denominator ½ and ⅓. In like manner, eight to two is a duplicate reaſon of eight to four, becauſe eight is double to four, but eight is the double of the double of two. If there be four terms in the ſame continued Reaſon, that of the firſt and laſt is triple to that of the firſt and ſecond, as if one put theſe four Numbers, two, four, eight, ſixteen; the reaſon of two to ſixteen is triple of two to four; for two is the half of the half of the half of ſixteen. As the reaſon of ſixteen to two, is triple of ſixteen to eight; for ſixteen is the double of eight, and it is the double of the double of the double of two.</p>

There may then be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed a Polygon Priſm in the Cylinder A, greater than the quantity L.

We have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that the quantity G, in reſpect of the Cylinder B, was in Triple Ratio of the Diameter DC to the Diameter EF.

In ſuch ſort that the quantity D, and MP taken together, be equal to the hemi-ſphere. Make or conceive it ſo made, that there be the ſame Ratio of a great Circle of the Sphere to the Baſe MO, as of the height MN to the height R.
